# Playing with Sentence-Transformers

Late to the game, but here's me dipping my toes into semantic search et al.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (I used 3.10.12)

Installing the requirements.txt should get you started. I was concerned the
laptop I was using would choke on the [MiniLM-L12-v2 example][L12], since I
saw nvidia dependencies being installed and my GPU is AMD, but for a start,
it runs fine.

I'm fully expecting it to splutter when more heavy work is done.
